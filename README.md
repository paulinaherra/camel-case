## Camel Case 
Implement additional tests (preferably in a TDD manner) and logic to convert the following Strings to camel case format:

1. digital-product-development
2. Digital_Product_Development

The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized:

1. digitalProductDevelopment
2. DigitalProductDevelopment
